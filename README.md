# B Bhattarai MultiModal Learning Lab (MMLL)

Description
Multimodal Learning Lab is a cross-border lab based at the University of Aberdeen and NAAMII, Nepal. Dr. Binod Bhattarai co-founded NAAMII, Nepal, in 2018. The lab focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for processing information from both real and synthetic heterogeneous sources, such as vision, text, and speech, to enable computers to understand, interpret, and reason. The applications include computer vision, medical image analysis, energy, agriculture, and low-resource language processing.
